**A record:** The most common resource record, used to point a certain domain name at a certain IPv4 IP address

**Anycast:** A technique that's used to route traffic to different destinations depending on factors like location, congestion, or link health

**Automatic allocation:** A range of IP addresses is set aside for assignment purposes

**Caching and recursive name servers:** They are generally provided by an ISP or your local network, and their purpose is to store domain name lookups for a certain amount of time

**CNAME:** A resource record used to map one domain to another

**DHCP discovery:** The process by which a client configured to use DHCP attempts to get network configuration information

**Domain Name System (DNS):** A global and highly distributed network service that resolves strings of letters, such as a website name, into an IP address

**DNS zones:** A portion of space in the Domain Name System (DNS) that is controlled by an authoritative name server

**Domain:** Used to demarcate where control moves from a top-level domain name server to an authoritative name server

**Domain name:** A website name; the part of the URL following www.

**Dynamic allocation:** A range of IP addresses is set aside for client devices and one of these IPs is issued to these devices when they request one

**Fixed allocation:** Requires a manually specified list of MAC address and the corresponding IPs

**Fully qualified domain name:** When you combine all the parts of a domain together

**IP masquerading:** The NAT obscures the sender's IP address from the receiver

**MX record:** It stands for mail exchange and this resource record is used in order to deliver email to the correct server

**Name resolution:** This process of using DNS to turn a domain name into an IP address

**Network Address Translation (NAT):** A mitigation tool that lets organizations use one public IP address and many private IP addresses within the network

**NS record:** It indicates other name servers that may also be responsible for a particular zone

**NTP servers**: Used to keep all computers on a network synchronized in time

**Pointer resource record:** It resolves an IP to a name

**Port forwarding:** A technique where specific destination ports can be configured to always be delivered to specific nodes

**Port preservation**: A technique where the source port chosen by a client, is the same port used by the router

**Proxy service**: A server that acts on behalf of a client in order to access another service

**Quad A (AAAA) record:** It is very similar to an A record except that it returns in IPv6 address instead of an IPv4 address

**Recursive name servers:** Servers that perform full DNS resolution requests

**Reverse lookup zone files:** They let DNS resolvers ask for an IP, and get the FQDN associated with it returned

**Reverse proxy:** A service that might appear to be a single server to external clients, but actually represents many servers living behind it

**Round robin:** It is a concept that involves iterating over a list of items one by one in an orderly fashion

**SRV record:** A service record used to define the location of various specific services

**Start of authority:** A declaration of the zone and the name of the name server that is authoritative for it

**Top Level Domain (TLD):** The top level of the DNS or the last part of a domain name. For example, the “com” in www.weather.com

**Time-To-Live field (TTL):** An 8-bit field that indicates how many router hops a datagram can traverse before it's thrown away

**Two-factor authentication:** A technique where more than just a username and password are required to authenticate. Usually, a short-lived numerical token is generated by the user through a specialized piece of hardware or software

**TXT record:** It stands for text and was originally intended to be used only for associating some descriptive text with a domain name for human consumption

**Types of DNS servers:** There are five primary types of DNS servers; caching name servers, recursive name servers, root name servers, TLD name servers, and authoritative name servers

**Virtual Private Network (VPN):** A technology that allows for the extension of a private or local network, to a host that might not work on that same local network

**Zone Files:** Simple configuration files that declare all resource records for a particular zone
