**Ad-Hoc network:** A network configuration without supporting network infrastructure. Every device involved with the ad-hoc network communicates with every other device within range, and all nodes help pass along messages

**Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL):** A device that establishes data connections across phone lines and different speeds for uploading and downloading data

**Baud rate:** A measurement of how many bits could be passed across a phone line in a second

**Bluetooth:** The most common short range wireless network

**Broadband:** Any connectivity technology that isn't dial-up Internet

**Cable modem:** A device that sits at the edge of a consumer's network and

connects it to the cable modem termination system

**Cable modem termination system:** Connects lots of different cable connections

to an ISP's core network

**Channels:** Individual, smaller sections of the overall frequency band used by a wireless network

**Collision domain:** A network segment where only one device can communicate at a time

**Data payload section:** Has all of the data of the protocols further up the stack of a frame

**Dial-up:** Uses POTS for data transfer, and gets its name because the connection is established by actually dialing a phone number

**DSL:** Digital subscriber line was able to send much more data across the wire than traditional dial-up technologies by operating at a frequency range that didn't interfere with normal phone calls

**DSLAM:** Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexers are devices that connect multiple DSL connections to a high-speed digital communications channel

**Duration field:** Specifies how long the total frame is

**Frame check sequence:** It is a 4-byte or 32-bit number that represents a checksum value for the entire frame

**Frame control field:** 16 bits long, it contains a number of sub-fields that are used to

describe how the frame itself should be processed

**Frequency band:** A certain section of the radio spectrum that's been agreed upon to be used for certain communications

**FTTB:** Fiber to the building, fiber to the business or even fiber to the basement, since this is generally where cables to buildings physically enter. FTTB is a setup where fiber technologies are used for data delivery to an individual building

**FTTH:** Fiber to the home. This is used in instances where fiber is actually run to each individual residents in a neighborhood or apartment building

**FTTN:** Fiber to the neighborhood. This means that fiber technologies are used to deliver data to a single physical cabinet that serves a certain amount of the population

**FTTP:** Fiber to the premises. FTTH and FTTB may both also be referred to as FTTP

**FTTX:** Stands for fiber to the X, where the X can be one of many things

**HDSL:** High Bit-rate Digital Subscriber Lines. These are DSL technologies that provision speeds above 1.544 megabits per second

**MAC filtering:** Access points are configured to only allow for connections from a specific set of MAC addresses belonging to devices you trust

**Mesh networks:** Like ad-hoc networks, lots of devices communicate with each other device, forming a mesh if you were to draw lines for all the links between all the nodes

**Metered connection:** An internet connection where all data transfer usage is tracked. Cell phone plans that have a limit on data usage per month or that charge based on usage are examples of metered connections

**Non-metered connection:** A connection where your data usage is not tracked or limited, instead you are charged a flat fee for unlimited and unrestricted usage. A Wi-Fi connection is an example of a non-metered connectionÂ 

**Optical Network Terminator:** Converts data from protocols the fiber network can

understand to those that are more traditional twisted pair copper networks can understand

**Pairing:** When a wireless peripheral connects to a mobile device, and the two devices exchange information, sometimes including a PIN or password, so that they can remember each other

**Point-To-Point VPN:** Establishes a VPN tunnel between two sites but VPN tunneling logic is handled by network devices at either side, so that users don't all have to establish their own connections

**Receiving address:** The MAC address of the access point that should receive the frame

**Symmetric Digital Subscriber Line (SDSL):** A device that establishes data connections across phone lines and has upload and download speeds that are the same

**Sequence control field:** A field that is 16 bits long and mainly contains a sequence number used to keep track of ordering the frames

**Short-range wireless network:** It is what mobile devices uses to connect to their peripherals

**T-Carrier technologies:** Technologies Invented to transmit multiple phone calls over a single link. Eventually, they also became common transmission systems to transfer data much faster than any dial-up connection could handle

**Transmitter address:** The MAC address of whatever has just transmitted the frame

**Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA):** A security program that uses a 128-bit key to protect wireless computer networks, which makes it more difficult to crack than WEP

**Wide area network:** Acts like a single network but spans across multiple physical locations. WAN technologies usually require that you contract a link across the Internet with your ISP

**Wired Equivalence Privacy (WEP):** An encryption technology that provides a very low level of privacy. WEP should really only be seen as being as safe as sending unencrypted data over a wired connection

**Wireless access point:** A device that bridges the wireless and wired portions of a network

**Wireless LANS (WLANS):** One or more access points act as a bridge between a wireless and a wired network

**Wireless networking:** Networks you connect to through radios and antennas
